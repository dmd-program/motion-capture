# Chapter 4 (Face/Video Capture)

For this chapter we will cover face capture and video capture that are big features of Rokoko Studio. These two features do not require the suit, but the face capture requires a license you need to pay for. The video capture is 100% free and a fun way to dip your toes into the motion capture technology. I highly suggest starting with video capture to have some fun and see how you enjoy the technology and see if it’s viable for your project’s needs. Video motion capture is a little janky right now, but I still see it as a tool that has a low bar to entry. 

Face capture on the other hand is a topic that could be expanded on greatly in complexity. The face capture in Rokoko Studio like the suits, is a powerful tool but, needs a lot of hand tuning and fixing to fully work. Plus, you will need to pay for the studio license and a face capture license to start using this technology in Rokoko Studio. There are other iPhone apps such as Unreal Engines Live Link that are completely free and can be used in Unreal Engine or another 3D program such as Blender. I would recommend a free face capture app first to see if this technology interests you because it will give you similar results to the Rokoko face capture.
