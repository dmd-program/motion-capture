# Chapter 3 (Unreal Engine)

This chapter we will cover Rokoko Studio to Unreal Engine workflow. I will be upfront and say Unreal Engine IS NOT EASY to work in, so you need to make sure you're prepared to take on this program on top of the motion capture bugs and glitches. With that being said, Unreal Engine is an incredibly powerful game engine that can produce incredible results but there will be a large technical learning curve. Since there is a large learning curve and the program has many different feature sets, make sure you narrow down what parts of the engine you need to learn for your project. Lastly, as of writing this Unreal Engine 5 has major bugs and workflow issues so I strongly advise you use version 4.27 for any work you're doing with motion capture.

This tutorial should cover how to use the Live Link Plugin to livestream data into Unreal Engine from Rokoko Studio. You will need to purchase a monthly studio license to be able to use the livestream function in Rokoko Studio. Livestreaming isn't completely necessary in most cases of workflows but makes it easier to take a recorded take from Rokoko Studio into UE 4.27 faster. This tutorial also uses Metahuman which is a powerful character creation tool free through Unreal Engine/Epic Games. Although this isn't necessary, you can use your own characters and create a rig using Mixamo so that you can use it in Unreal Engine. If you're going to use Metahuman characters, then you will NEED the below files for it to work for livestreaming.

# Other Tutorials

For Unreal Engine motion capture you can go down a rabbit hole of technical videos and workflows that can be easily overwhelming even for people who know their way around Unreal Engine. Below I am going to link a mix of highly technical tutorials as well as beginner tutorials for different workflows/situations. Again, please make sure to check the date of the tutorials and versions of the tools being used in the video so that you know it is a viable workflow to use.
